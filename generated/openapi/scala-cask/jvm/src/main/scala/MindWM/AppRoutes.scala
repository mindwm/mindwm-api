/**
 * This trait encapsulates the business logic (services) and the
 * http routes which handle the http requests sent to those services.
 *
 * There are default 'not implemented' implementations for the service.
 *
 * If you wanted fine-grained control over the routes and services, you could
 * extend the cask.MainRoutes and mix in this trait by using this:
 *
 * \{\{\{
 *   override def allRoutes = appRoutes
 * \}\}\}
 *
 * More typically, however, you would extend the 'BaseApp' class
